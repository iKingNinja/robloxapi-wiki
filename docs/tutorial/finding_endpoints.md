# Finding endpoints
The first thing you’ll need to know when accessing the API is what endpoint you’ll need to do something. 
Try to stay away from endpoints on `api.roblox.com` or `www.roblox.com` - they are usually old and there are almost 
always better alternatives on other subdomains.

You should also keep track of the 
[Official List of Deprecated Web Endpoints](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/official-list-of-deprecated-web-endpoints/62889)
for updates on when endpoints are disabled.

Roblox has a "consolidated page" that contains most domains and endpoints that you can use to find the endpoint you need
at https://api.roblox.com/docs?useConsolidatedPage=true.

You can also access the documentation for an individual domain by appending /docs to the end of it 
(`users.roblox.com` > `users.roblox.com/docs`). You can find a list of these subdomains [here](/subdomain_list).

Some domains don’t have documentation available, like `realtime.roblox.com`.
