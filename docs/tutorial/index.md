# Get started

!!! note
    This tutorial covers usage of Roblox's older "BEDEV1" APIs.
    If you're interested in Roblox's new Open Cloud system, see Roblox's official [Open Cloud tutorial.](https://create.roblox.com/docs/open-cloud/index)


As a developer, there are two main ways youâ€™ll want to access the Roblox API: sending the requests yourself or using one
of the API wrappers available for your programming language of choice. 

This tutorial covers sending requests yourself. Before you attempt this, it is encouraged that you take a look at
the [library list](/library-list.md) and see if any libraries cover your use case.
