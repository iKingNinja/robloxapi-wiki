# Get started

!!! note
    This tutorial covers usage of Roblox's "BEDEV1" APIs, which are much more comprehensive than the newer "Open Cloud" APIs.
    Consider checking Roblox's official [Open Cloud docs](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/cloud) to see if your usecase is supported.


There are two main ways youâ€™ll want to access the Roblox API: sending the requests yourself or using one of the API 
wrappers available for your programming language of choice. 

This tutorial covers sending requests yourself. Before you attempt this, it is encouraged that you take a look at
the [List of libraries](/list-of-libraries.md) and see if any libraries cover your use case.
