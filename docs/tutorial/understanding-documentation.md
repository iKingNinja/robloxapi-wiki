# Understanding documentation
Each documentation page contains a list of public endpoints available on that domain and lots of information about how to use them. This article will tell you how to understand this documentation.

## All requests

Documentation for all types of requests will always contain the following:  

- The text in top left corner and the background color differ depending on the method of the request, most often GET or POST.  
- The Example Value contains an example of what the response from this endpoint might look like - this is useful when you want to build code that requests to an endpoint without sending a request to it yourself to figure out how it responds.
- The Response Content Type determines what should be passed to the `Accept` header - there’s almost never any reason to change this.  
- The Parameters change what data is passed to the endpoint when sending the request. The data is passed as a query string or as part of the URL for GET requests and is passed as a JSON body in almost all other requests.  
- The Response Messages will explain what different HTTP Status Codes mean when returned from the server - if you’re getting an error without enough information, you can check the response messages to see if that status code means something for that endpoint.  
- The "Try it out!" button will send a request to this endpoint with the data supplied in the Parameters. This will be useful for testing out an endpoint without writing code to send requests.  

## Requests with a body

Requests with a body, like POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, have extra data attached. 
As you can see, we’ve got a parameter labeled `request`, which just refers to the body of the request, as you can see
from the "Parameter Type" to the right of it.  

We also are able to change that data’s content type - you’ll almost always want to keep this on `application/json` given
most endpoints accept JSON. You’ll also see an "Example Value" - this shows you an example of data you can pass as the
request body. Clicking on that Example Value will immediately set the body to the example data. This is useful for 
quickly testing an endpoint before implementing it into your program.
